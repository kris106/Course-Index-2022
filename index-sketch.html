<p>For this assignment, you are tasked with developing a daily practice of "code sketches." Rather than constructing a single project, your goal is to allot daily time to exploring generative art. With your assigned letter as your inspiration, create 21 code “sketches” of that letter in p5 over the course of 3 weeks.</p>
<br></br>
<p>Why “sketch” daily</p>
<p>
    This module does not ask you to develop a deep conceptual component to your work. Instead, the goal is to experiment with tools daily. Sketches provide the opportunity to build capacity with your tools by building momentum. You’re not expected to spend hours a day on your task, but instead just allot 30 minutes to create a new sketch built off what you’ve previously done. Regular engagement with p5 will ensure a deeper understanding of its capacity and how you can deploy it.
    
    The hardest part of a daily practice is motivation to continue. I will regularly suggest you post your process on discord for your peers to be inspired and vice versa. My own facility with p5 is quite limited so I too will be following this along this assignment and posting my output.
</p>
    
<p>Final output</p>

    Series of 21 Sketches 1000px × 1000px, each sketch hosted on your course index site. 
    Class poster to be assembled, printed on risograph, and mailed out to students
