            I see that the two authors pose a shared opinion on open-sourced software. Both articles are examples of obstacles designers face having their practice unwillingly controlled by large tech corporations. Mueller outlines the maintenance of open-sourced code while Hartnett focuses on the standardized tools of design being in the hands of big tech. What I can draw from both these articles is the desire to have open-sourced design tools that can work seamlessly with standardized design tools and can also be expanded/modified by the average person. Mueller specifically outlines the problem of copyright laws being applied to code rather than patents that allow free public access after 20 years. The use of copyrighted code makes it increasingly harder for any open-sourced tools to be built off the back of preexisting code making the daunting task of having to code many design tools from scratch. Harrett also mentions that design tools have uniformly drawn people in, update after update integrating these tools to become the design standard allowing people to become under the influence of planned obsolescence and nontransparent companies. Solutions to the authoritarian use of standardized big tech software are displayed in Mueller's article referring to piracy and open-source maintenance which can lead to the use of open-sourcing hacked code while maintaining this code to a standardized level. Hartnett Mentions the move away from leading standard design tools as a potential decoupling of designers and primary design tools owned by big tech like Apple and Adobe which could strengthen the movement of open-sourced design tools taking power out of the hands of big tech and back into the hands of designers wishing to no longer be at the whim of such things as price changes or involuntary updates.

            I would like to make personal mention of my observations of design tools and open-sourced tools. I find that there may be an increasing balance between open-sourced tools and the current standardized Adobe tools while the hardware of Apple is very hard to replace even though every new MacBook become increasingly more expensive along with the updates that force out older programs many of which happen to be open-sourced due to a lack of maintenance. Some open-source design tools include Krita for animation and Figma's community Beta for access to other users' design files creating a community around open-sourced design.

        <p class="desc-style">
            Integral skills in Graphic Design that I see are the following and in brackets will have the current standardized tool the ability to draw vector graphics (illustrator), photo editing/manipulation (photoshop/lightroom), video compositing/editing (premiere), advanced video editing (after effects), wireframing/prototyping (sketch/invision), and coding (html/css/java script). These are integral depending on a graphic designer's specialization, however, these are many of the main requirements I see in Google searches for graphic design work internet job postings. The space of graphic design has largely moved online taking what used to be done mainly with a pencil and craft knife into an entire paid suite mainly controlled by Adobe and operating from either an Apple device or Microsoft device.

            A key part to generative design and code is pattern and routine. Akin to a chess player, marking each move
            down, and keeping a trace of your decisions can prove useful for your own process and future making. As a
            designer, to know that there might be a variety of possibilities to a given situation, can aid our ways of
            observing by using tools in novel ways. In one series of work, Van Rossum looks to fundamentals of waveforms
            as a departure point and reference point for connecting an interface to affecting the parameters of a
            letterform. If the letters explode, so too would the speakers. Find 1 unique example of a pattern in nature,
            that appears to be programmatic. Post a visual of this pattern and describe how it is programmatic in
            nature.

            A pattern in nature that appears to be programmatic is the way frequencies react with the eardrum. While
            searching for a unique example I stumbled upon a model eardrum-making experiment that described forming an
            eardrum and placing light objects on the surface such as sand or sprinkles to visually notice the different
            reactions the frequencies cause. This can be compared to the generative art process of creating patterns and
            routines while noting down progress to allow the creator to experiment with different paths in their work.
            Different objects can be used to visualize frequencies of sound on an eardrum to experiment with how the
            natural frequencies interact with objects such as water and different colors or weights of powder. In the
            video example, I provided you can see a large difference in the complexity of the shapes created as the
            frequency rises from the 300s to the 2000s there is a clear difference in the complexity going from
            something that starts off looking like a cross-section and turning into a more detailed pattern as the
            frequency gets up to over 2000. Interestingly the way the forms take shape in a symmetrical fashion
            naturally morph into smooth clearly outlined shapes based on the frequency as if premade by nature.
